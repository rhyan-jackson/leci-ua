// The data structure
//
// A BW image is stored in a structure containing 3 fields:
// Two integers store the image width and height.
// The other field is a pointer to an array that stores the pointers
// to the RLE compressed image rows.
//
// Clients should use images only through variables of type Image,
// which are pointers to the image structure, and should not access the
// structure fields directly.

// Constant value --- Use them throughout your code
// const uint8 BLACK = 1;  // Black pixel value, defined on .h
// const uint8 WHITE = 0;  // White pixel value, defined on .h
const int EOR = -1;  // Stored as the last element of a RLE row

// Internal structure for storing RLE BW images
struct image {
  uint32 width;
  uint32 height;
  int** row;  // pointer to an array of pointers referencing the compressed rows
};

// This module follows "design-by-contract" principles.
// Read `Design-by-Contract.md` for more details.

/// Error handling functions

// In this module, only functions dealing with memory allocation or
// file (I/O) operations use defensive techniques.
// When one of these functions fails,
// it immediately prints an error and exits the program.
// This fail-fast approach to error handling is simpler for the programmer.

// Use the following function to check a condition
// and exit if it fails.

// Check a condition and if false, print failmsg and exit.
static void check(int condition, const char* failmsg) {
  if (!condition) {
    perror(failmsg);
